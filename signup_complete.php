                Admins can create projects, entries, events for 
                calendars, employee accounts, manager accounts, and even other admin accounts. They have complete control over all in this list from their company.
                They can add, delete, alter, and recover them if needed later. They can also change the settings of their company. They can also travel through space faster than light. There isn't much they can't do. 
            </p>
        </div>

            <p> 
                Managers can add, delete, and alter the entries and events of the employees that they are assigned to. They can see the 
                entries of the assigned employees and projects. They can't do as many things as admins, but they are still cool.

            <p> 
                Employees can clock time. They can be clocking time to an assigned project, given job code or No Project if you don't like projects. 
                They can view a calendar to see when they work. This will have events on it that you can create. The employees mainly just clock time, but they also cool.
