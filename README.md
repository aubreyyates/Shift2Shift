# Shift2Shift
This is an online software project. I am currently working closely with Abram Nothnagle to develope it. It uses HTML, CSS,
PHP, and Javascript in its coding. 

If you want to see an early build of the project go to https://shift2shift.azurewebsites.net/. If you use it, be aware that
ALL data may be deleted in the future.
